Please pardon the clich√© title, but I had to start somewhere.

This is my new personal site and blog. I expect it to mostly track my coding work, a place to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings, but I am open to seeing where it goes.

Some of the topics I expect my turn up are ruby, rails, postgres, vim and tools I use and enjoy working with.

If any of that interests you, welcome aboard.
